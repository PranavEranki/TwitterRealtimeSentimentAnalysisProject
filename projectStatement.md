A web page that will analyze a series of tweets filtered by a topic using the twitter api (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/overview), and use python NLTK to analyze if a tweet is positive or negative.

A simple example of this would be (https://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/)  and instead of inputting a text, I would input a topic which would then show the last 10 tweets with the sentiment analysis as positive or negative.

The webpage should be a very simple text box that will let me enter in a topic, you then would get the last 10 tweets of that topic using twitter api, perform the sentiment analysis using NLTK and then show the 10 tweets in a table with a column specifying if the sentiment was positive or negative.
